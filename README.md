# Mapillary Java API

Mapillay API as Java Library see https://www.mapillary.com/developer/api-documentation/
This Project should wrap the complete API with Java Functions and Objects.

It is Work in Progress.
## What Is Implemented? ##
* OAuth authentication with ClientID (Custom ClientID, OAuth Token Link possible). For this we need a Webserver to get the Token. Everything is built in and should work out of the Box. If you have an external Token you can skip this step and just work with the API.
* Download Sequences
* Download Image Metadata
* Users and Statistcs
* Pagination (50%)
* Create UploadSequence (New, What sequences are open, delete and publish)
* Example Code

## What to Come ##
* image Upload
* Everything Else: Changeset, Map Features, Object Detection 
* Documentation
Just give me time to implement it or help.
