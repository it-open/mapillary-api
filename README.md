# Mapillary Java API

Mapillay API as Java Library see https://www.mapillary.com/developer/api-documentation/
This Project should wrap the complete API with Java Functions and Objects.

It is Work in Progress.
## What Is Implemented? ##
* OAuth authentication with ClientID (Custom ClientID, OAuth Token Link possible). For this we need a Webserver to get the Token. Everything is built in and should work out of the Box. If you have an external Token you can skip this step and just work with the API.
* Downlaod Sequences (just started) and 
* With the previous Point - pagination.

## What to Come ##
Everything Else: Images (Download and Upload),Changeset, Map Features, Object Detection 
Just give me time to implement it or help.
